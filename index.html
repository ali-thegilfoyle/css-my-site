          <h3>Flutter | Android | UI/UX | Wordpress</h3>
          <p>
            I have 6 months of android development experience after that, I
            start to learn Flutter and side by side wordpress development. After
            completing both, during development I also learned UI/UX designing
            with Adobe XD and created my apps design wit that. And now this is
            what I am learning.

          <h3>Learning | Photography | Cricket | Books</h3>
          <p>
            Learing new things now is like a hobby for me, I feel very happy and
            excited during learning anything. In addition to that, for physical
            and mental health and development, I play cricket (that is my hobby
            from childhood) and love to read books. Last but not the least
            Photograph, I love to take pictures and play with DSLR cameras.
